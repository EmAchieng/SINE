A PyTorch implementation of "SINE: Scalable Incomplete Network Embedding" (ICDM 2018). The procedure learns an attributed node embedding using skip-gram like features with a shallow deep model. It is a fairly useful feature extraction tool when you need high accuracy node classification, vertex level regression or link prediction.
